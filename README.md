Project Name : Disease Prediction

Project Description :
This project is used to predict the disease based on the symptoms given by the user.It predicts using three different machine learning algorithms.The first algorithm is Naive bayes, second is a Random Forest and the last one is Decision forest.
Because If we use a single algorithm for our project then how we come to know that the prediction is correct.So thatâ€™s why i use three algorithms.

Tools used: Django
